Here’s a detailed task list divided into small chunks that will help learners build a foundational understanding of JavaScript. Each task focuses on solving a specific piece of functionality. Once they master these, they can mix and match these chunks to solve most problems.

1. Basic Console Usage
	•	Print a message to the console.
	•	Log the result of a mathematical operation (2 + 2).
	•	Log a variable’s value and track changes using console.log().

2. Variables and Data Types
	•	Declare a variable using let and const.
	•	Assign and reassign a value to a variable.
	•	Determine the type of a variable using typeof.

3. Loops
	•	Create a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
	•	Create a while loop to count down from 10 to 1.
	•	Use a for...of loop to iterate over an array of names.

4. Arrays
	•	Create an array with 5 elements and log it.
	•	Add a new element to the end of an array (.push()).
	•	Remove the last element from an array (.pop()).
	•	Iterate over an array and print each element.
	•	Find the length of an array.

5. Functions
	•	Create a function to add two numbers and return the result.
	•	Write a function that accepts a string and returns its uppercase version.
	•	Create a function to calculate the area of a rectangle.

6. Conditionals
	•	Write an if statement to check if a number is positive or negative.
	•	Use if...else if to classify a grade as “A”, “B”, or “Fail”.
	•	Create a switch case for selecting a fruit price.

7. Object Basics
	•	Create an object to store information about a car (e.g., make, model, year).
	•	Access and log the value of a property using dot notation.
	•	Add a new property to an existing object.

8. String Manipulation
	•	Concatenate two strings.
	•	Extract the first 5 characters of a string (.slice()).
	•	Replace a word in a string using .replace().

9. Event Handling (Basic DOM Interaction)
	•	Create a button and log a message when it is clicked.
	•	Change the background color of a div on a mouseover event.
	•	Toggle a class on an element when it is clicked.

10. Range-Based Tasks
	•	Print all even numbers between 1 and 20.
	•	Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.
	•	Create a range of numbers as an array and iterate over it.

11. Filtering and Mapping Arrays
	•	Filter out all numbers greater than 10 from an array.
	•	Transform an array of numbers into their squares (.map()).
	•	Find the first number greater than 5 in an array.

12. Object and Array Interaction
	•	Loop through an array of objects and log a specific property from each object.
	•	Add a new key-value pair to each object in an array of objects.
	•	Sort an array of objects by a property (e.g., age).

13. Working with Dates
	•	Get the current date and log it.
	•	Format a date into DD/MM/YYYY format.
	•	Calculate the difference in days between two dates.

14. User Input Handling
	•	Create a prompt to take the user’s name and log it.
	•	Ask the user for two numbers and log their sum.
	•	Validate that the user enters a number.

15. Asynchronous Tasks
	•	Log “Start”, then use setTimeout() to log “After 2 seconds”.
	•	Fetch data from a mock API and log it.
	•	Use async/await to fetch user data.

16. Error Handling
	•	Write a try...catch block to handle division by zero.
	•	Throw a custom error if a value is not a number.
	•	Catch an error when parsing invalid JSON.

17. Array Search and Calculation
	•	Find the index of a specific value in an array.
	•	Count how many times a specific value appears in an array.
	•	Check if an array contains a particular value.

18. Pattern Recognition
	•	Print a right triangle pattern using nested loops:

*
**
*
**


	•	Create a checkerboard pattern for an n x n grid.
	•	Count the occurrences of each character in a string.

19. Basic Algorithms
	•	Reverse a string without using .reverse().
	•	Find the largest number in an array.
	•	Check if a string is a palindrome.

20. Real-World Simulations
	•	Create a to-do list where you can add and remove tasks.
	•	Implement a simple calculator for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
	•	Create a shopping cart simulation where you can add/remove items and calculate the total cost.

These tasks break down most programming scenarios into actionable chunks. Each task is small enough to be learned individually but contributes to a larger skillset. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific task or provide solutions?
